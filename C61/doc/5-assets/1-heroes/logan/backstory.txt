Logan was once a proud member of the United Space Marines, serving on various missions across the galaxy to protect humanity from alien threats. However, a devastating incident on one of his missions left him as the sole survivor, leading him to question his faith in the organization. This, combined with the corruption he witnessed within the U.S.M, led him to desert and become a mercenary-for-hire, using his skills to make a living in the dangerous and unpredictable world of the post-apocalyptic universe.

As a lonewolf, Logan is fiercely independent and trusts no one but himself. He has a reputation for getting the job done, no matter the cost, and has a strict code of ethics that he adheres to in order to maintain his sense of morality in a world gone mad. Despite his rough exterior, Logan has a soft spot for those in need and will often take on jobs that help others, even if it means putting himself in harm's way.

In this cyberpunk world, Logan has upgraded his body with cybernetic enhancements to give him an edge in combat, but he also values his humanity and tries not to rely too heavily on his technology. He roams the galaxy on his spacecraft, the "Lone Wolf", always on the lookout for his next job and a way to make sense of the chaos that surrounds him.
